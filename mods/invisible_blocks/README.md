# invisible-blocks
This mod is intended for server admins. 


The blocks prepared by the mod are parts of the MineLife Blocks mod from the following server:
minelife-minetest.de

## Barriers
These can be placed to prevent others from entering an area.
**!!These blocks can only be removed by World-Edit!!**

## Invisible light sources

This block can be used to place invisible light sources.
As soon as a block is built over it, it disappears.
You can thus beautifully illuminate large squares or even buildings.
